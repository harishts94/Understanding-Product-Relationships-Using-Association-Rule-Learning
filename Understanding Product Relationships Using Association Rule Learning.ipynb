    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Our client is looking to re-jig the alcohol section within their store. Customers are often complaining that they can’t find the products they want, and are also wanting recommendations about which other products to try. On top of this, their marketing team would like to start running “bundled” promotions as this has worked well in other areas of the store - but need guidance with selecting which products to put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have provided us a sample of 3,500 alcohol transactions - our task is fairly open - to see if we can find solutions or insights that might help the business address the aforementioned problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based upon the tasks at hand - we apply Association Rule Learning, specifically Apriori to examine & analyse the strength of relationship between different products within the transactional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We firstly installed the apyori package, which contains all of the required functionality for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then needed to bring in the sample data, and get it into the right format for the Apriori algorithm to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there we apply the Apriori algorithm to provide us with several different relationship metrics, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support\n",
    "- Confidence\n",
    "- Expected Confidence\n",
    "- Lift\n",
    "                                                                            \n",
    "These metrics examine product relationships in different ways, so we utilise each to put forward ideas that address each of the tasks at hand. You can read more about these metrics, and the Apriori algorithm in the relevant section below."

    "### Apriori Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rule Learning is an approach that discovers the strength of relationships between different data-points. It is commonly utilised to understand which products are frequently (or infrequently) purchased together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a business sense this can provide some really interesting, and useful information that can help optimise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Arrangement/Placement (making the customer journey more efficient)\n",
    "- Product Recommendations (customers who purchased product A also purchased product B)\n",
    "- Bundled Discounts (which products should/should not be put together)\n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful, intuitive, and commonly used algorithm for Association Rule Learning is Apriori.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Apriori there are four key metrics, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support\n",
    "- Confidence\n",
    "- Expected Confidence\n",
    "- Lift\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these metrics help us understand items, and their relationship with other items in their own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support\n",
    "Support is extremely intuitive, it simply tells us the percentage of all transactions that contain both Item A and Item B. To calculate this we’d just count up the transactions that include both items, and divide this by the total number of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Support as a baseline metric that helps us understand how common or popular this particular pair of items is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence takes us a little bit further than Support, and looks more explcitly at the relationship between the two items.\n",
    "\n",
    "It asks “of all transactions that included item A, what proportion also included item B?”\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, here we are counting up the number of transactions that contained both items A and B and then rather than dividing by all transactions like we did for Support, we instead divide this by the total number of transactions that contained item A.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high score for Confidence can mean a strong product relationship - but not always! When one of the items is very popular we can get an inflated score. To help us regulate this, we can look at two further metrics, Expected Confidence and Lift!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Confidence is quite simple, it is the percentage of all transactions that contained item B.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important as it provides indication of what the Confidence would be if there were no relationship between the items. We can use Expected Confidence, along with Confidence to calculate our final (and most powerful) metric - Lift!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lift\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift is the factor by which the Confidence, exceeds the Expected Confidence. In other words, Lift tells us how likely item B is purchased when item A is purchased, while controlling for how popular item B is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate Lift by dividing Confidence by Expected Confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Lift score greater than 1 indicates that items A & B appear together more often than expected, and conversely a Lift score less then 1 indicates that items A & B appear together less often than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "While above we’re just discussing two products (Item A & Item B) - in reality this score would be calculated between all pairs of products, and we could then sort these by Lift score (for example) and see exactly what the strongest or weakest relationships were - and this information would guide our decisions regarding product layout, recommendations for customers, or promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Important Consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to consider when assessing the results of Apriori is that, Item/Product relationships that have a high Lift score but also have a low Support score should be interpreted with caution!\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we sorted all Item relationships by descending Lift score, the one that comes out on top might initially seem very impressive and it may appear that there is a very strong relationship between the two items. Always take into account the Support metric - it could be that this relationship is only taking place by chance due to the rarity of the item set.\n",
